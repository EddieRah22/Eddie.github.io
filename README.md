# Eddie.github.io
My name is Edwin Gallegos
My Email is engallegos@my.waketech.edu
This is my first time using GitHub so as of right now plan to use it for this class.
As I said it is my first time working with this software so my repository is nothing major and will only be used for this course
First I installed Git, then I downloaded the repository files then I moved the files to wherever I wanted them on my PC and that was all
